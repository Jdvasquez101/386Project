  - heading: Version Control
    text: Although Unity offers a Version Control system called PlasticSCM, I still
      recommend git. Use of a proper gitignore is essential to avoid excessive tracking
      of files. .meta files are important to retain, as they are used to maintain
      references within scenes and other purposes.

  - heading: Monobehaviours
    text: Scripts in Unity are attached to GameObjects by inheriting the Monobehaviour
      class. This allows access to numerous methods that are accessed through regular
      gameplay events, such as Awake, Start, Update, and OnCollisionEnter2D<br><br>Fields
      will be exposed in the Unity Editor's Inspector if they are:<br>1. Public<br>2.
      Prefaced with the [SerializeField] tag<br>3. Are a property with the [field:SerializeField]
      tag<br><br>Awake is where objects should set their references and perform internal
      setup logic, while Start is where they should perform code that depends on
      other objects to be properly initialized. Update runs on every frame, while
      FixedUpdate runs every physics update.

  - heading: Input System
    text: The current recommended way to access inputs is Unity's Input System package,
      which provides abstracted controls that allow developers to handle multiple
      input methods (mouse+keyboard, gamepad) with consistent means. There are numerous
      ways to use these inputs.

  - heading: Player Input
    text: An easy Unity provided way to implement behaviors reacting to Input System
      inputs. Though there are multiple ways for this to be utilized, perhaps the
      simplest involves the PlayerInput component sending messages to all attached
      scripts based on the name of the inputs.<br>For example, the Move input will
      send a message with input information to all scripts implementing the function<br>public
      void OnMove(InputAction)

  - heading: Serialization
    text: Serialization refers to the conversion of objects in memory to a text string
      that can be parsed, or deserialized, back into an object. This is a very helpful,
      if not necessary, element of saving and loading. Unity offers a json utility
      that is capable of serializing a C# object and creating/modifying an object
      based on the produced JSON, effectively enabling saving and loading data. This
      can be used with playerprefs or direct filesystem access via the C# System.IO
      namespace, or any alternative interface providing access to persistent storage.

  - heading: PlayerPrefs
    text: PlayerPrefs are a simple means of saving persistent data. They store data
      of a primative type (string, int, or float). If you want to save other types
      of data, you probably want to convert it to/from a string. You can see an example
      of this with a Vector3 in PersistLocation. This can also be performed on more
      complicated objects. Alternatively, you can create functions that convert objects
      to strings or assign values based off of the contents of a string.<br><br>When
      saved strings get too long for PlayerPrefs, or you want more control over how/where
      files are stored, you may wish to directly interact with the System.IO namespace.
