  - heading: Animation Clip
    text: You can animate any serialized field within an Animation Clip. A common
      use of this is animating the sprite associated with an object. The clip provides
      information about values and timing on specific frames, known as key frames.
      When working with values such as floats, you can also determine the curve used
      to interpolate between values on non-key frames.

  - heading: 'Animator '
    text: An animator is a sort of controller for an object that can help manage
      a number of animation clips within a state machine. Each node in the graph
      is associated with an animation, and can be connected to other nodes with transitions.
      Transitions can be given conditions using parameters that belong to the animator.
      These parameters can be manipulated through code to indicate the desired state
      to the animator.

  - heading: StateMachineBehaviours
    text: StateMachineBehaviours can be used to execute code during certain points
      within a node's lifecycle. This can be useful to trigger conditions at appropriate
      times, such as indicating the start or end of a particular state, or even manipulating
      the gameobject or other components.
