  sections:
  - heading: DontDestroy
    text: Calling DontDestroyOnLoad(obj) will ensure obj does not get unloaded when
      changing scenes, which can be useful if you have any logic that benefits from
      persisting across scenes. One simple example of this is to allow audio to play
      as the user transitions between scenes.

  - heading: AudioSource
    text: Sound files can be played through an AudioSource, which will be listened
      to through AudioListeners (usually attached to Cameras). Audio sources can
      have a resource loaded in, or have methods available that allow other objects
      to play any audio resource they provide. Audio Sources can be assigned to an
      Audio Mixer group for fine tuned volume and effect control. It is possible
      to tweak distance based settings, allowing functionality like proximity-based
      audio, volume falloff, and the doppler effect.

  - heading: AudioMixer
    text: AudioMixers allow for a tree of AudioMixerGroups, which influence the volume
      and effects applied to AudioSources that belong to said groups. This is an
      easy way to control various volumes in a single, centralized location, as well
      as applying effects that modify sounds. You can expose variables in the audiomixer
      to be modifiable within code.

  - heading: ScriptableObjects
    text: ScriptableObjects are classes that define objects used to hold data. ScriptableObjects
      can be created within the Project Browser, and these assets can be referenced
      within code. While values assigned to them will persist within the Unity Editor,
      even if they are changed within play mode, this behavior is NOT exhibited during
      gameplay in a game build. It is possible to create functions within ScriptableObjects,
      though they do not have access to Monobehaviour lifecycle functions. This example's
      ScriptableObject only has one instance created, and is largely used to hold
      saved/loaded settings values, but they can be used in a large variety of contexts
      (weapon values used by a unified class, character stats used by a unified controller,
      etc). Their use differs from both GameObjects and pure C# structs or classes,
      so be sure to check the reference when you decide to use them.
