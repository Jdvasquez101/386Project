  - heading: Managers
    text: While you can use references, or find objects by tag or component, it may
      sometimes be easier to find using the (controversial) Singleton pattern. This
      is achieved by creating a public static reference to the class, and assigning
      it to the object upon creation. This allows any object in the scene to access
      both static and nonstatic information from the class with ease.<br>Many facets
      of your application may benefit from having a single manager coordinating larger
      complex commands, like destroying all enemies. This can be made even more consistent
      by creating it upon application start and setting donotdestroyonload so it
      persists across scenes.

  - heading: Creating Objects
    text: Using the Instantiate command, you can create a GameObject, which will
      be returned from the function call so that it can be modified immediately following
      creation. This is a great use of Prefabs, so you can carefully construct the
      object you want to be instantiated so that it has all of the components and
      values set up ahead of time.

  - heading: Destroying Objects
    text: Objects OR components can be disabled or destroyed. This will also activate
      the OnDestroy monobehaviour call, which can be used for any cleanup your object
      may require.

  - heading: Object Pooling
    text: The creation and destruction of objects is a resource intensive operation,
      and one effective optimization is to pool these objects, meaning that they
      are reused by disabling and re-enabling them, instead of creating and destroying
      them. Unity provides an ObjectPool class to help you manage pooled objects.

  - heading: UI - Canvas System
    text: UI objects using the canvas system are children of a Canvas object. Canvas
      objects can be in world space or a screen overlay (default) - The screen overlay
      system uses a separate coordinate system from gameobjects, and you must consider
      UI objects within it relative to their canvas instead of relative to their
      world space position.
