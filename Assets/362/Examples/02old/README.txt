Some files are presented as-is. While it is still recommended that you learn how to reproduce these scenes, or similar scenes, from scratch, no "start" scene has been created for you.

Notes: 
-The "Input System" package must be added to your project for code to compile properly.
-When opening Scene 05, TextMeshPro will prompt you to add necessary files, some features may not behave properly until you have done so.

Suggested Extensions:
-Create an engaging physics scenario utilizing player input to achieve some goal
-Create a scene with parallax scrolling using different art assets - You can find many online, https://opengameart.org/art-search-advanced?field_art_tags_tid=parallax is a good start
-Create a settings menu that allows users to control options such as volume with persistent storage
-Create a map that allows users to collect items, where a returning player resumes with their position and collected items
