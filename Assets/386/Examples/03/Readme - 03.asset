  - heading: Managers
    text: While you can use references, or find objects by tag or component, it may
      sometimes be easier to find using the (controversial) Singleton pattern. This
      is achieved by creating a public static reference to the class, and assigning
      it to the object upon creation, or destroying the object if it finds that another
      already exists. This allows any object in the scene to access both static and
      nonstatic information from the class with ease.<br>Many facets of your application
      may benefit from having a single manager (singleton or otherwise) coordinating
      larger complex commands, like destroying all enemies. This can be made even
      more consistent by creating it upon application start and setting donotdestroyonload
      so it persists across scenes.

  - heading: Creating Objects
    text: Using the Instantiate command, you can create a GameObject, which will
      be returned from the function call so that it can be modified immediately following
      creation. This is a great use of Prefabs, so you can carefully construct the
      object you want to be instantiated so that it has all of the components and
      values set up ahead of time.

  - heading: Destroying Objects
    text: Objects OR components can be disabled or destroyed. This will also activate
      the OnDestroy monobehaviour call, which can be used for any cleanup your object
      may require.

  - heading: Object Pooling
    text: The creation and destruction of objects is a resource intensive operation,
      and one effective optimization is to pool these objects, meaning that they
      are reused by disabling and re-enabling them, instead of creating and destroying
      them. Unity provides an ObjectPool class to help you manage pooled objects.

  - heading: Time
    text: Time.TimeScale can be set and used to control the rate of time flow within
      a game, directly affecting deltaTime. This can be used for slow motion, pausing,
      or fast forwarding gameplay. Time.deltaTime is commonly used, but Time.fixedDeltaTime
      may be more appropriate if you are working within the confines of the physics
      system. deltaTime will be converted to fixedDeltaTime if it is accessed within
      FixedUpdate, but it is still good to use fixedDeltaTime for clarity.
