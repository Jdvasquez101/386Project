  - heading: Scene Transitions
    text: Games can transition to different scenes at runtime. In order for the scene
      to be loaded, it must be included in Build Profiles > Scene List.<br>This involves<br>1.
      Unloading the current scene, and loading the next scene. This is the default
      behavior when using LoadScene.<br>2. A new scene can be added alongside the
      current scene. There is a second default argument that can be provided "LoadSceneMode.Additive"
      to use this behavior.<br><br>LoadSceneAsync and UnloadSceneAsync can also be
      used to load/unload scenes in the background while gameplay continues.

  - heading: Tilemaps
    text: Tilemaps allow for uniform placement of "tile" prefabs that can be easily
      edited, and treated as a singular object. Tilemaps can also be given colliders,
      and multiple tilemaps can exist within a single grid to allow for multiple
      layers or conditions. If accessing the linked reference, please also note the
      references for creating tiles and tile palettes, which are contained within
      the TileMap folder in this example.

  - heading: UI - Canvas System
    text: UI objects using the canvas system are children of a Canvas object. Canvas
      objects can be in world space or a screen overlay (default) - The screen overlay
      system uses a separate coordinate system from gameobjects, and you must consider
      UI objects within it relative to their canvas instead of relative to their
      world space position.

  - heading: Considerations for 3d Development
    text: While we are largely focus on 2d development within this class, many of
      the same principles can be utilized for 3d development. A lot of the math,
      notably rotation and translating controls to 3d coordinates, is a little trickier.

  - heading: Character Controller Component
    text: The Character Controller component allows for simple, non-physics based
      3d motion.

  - heading: Materials
    text: When creating 3d objects, generating and/or applying an appropriate material
      is necessary. If you create a material, you will see a number of options for
      use within the URP - including 2d and 3d varieties. Unity comes with a number
      of flexible shaders ready for use, and can be used to make surfaces appear
      shiny, or lit, or apply various distortions to the provided textures. You may
      wish to create and apply your own texture to the 3d scene in this example.
    linkText: Materials, Shaders, and Textures
    url: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/writing-custom-shaders.html
  - heading: Shaders
    text: These are shaders, which are low level scripts and allow for a great level
      of customization if you are willing to delve into their implementation - which
      is not a simple undertaking. You can get a starting look at provided shaders
      by selecting the shader asset from a material - two of which are provided in
      this example.

  - heading: Lighting
    text: When you add any lighting to the scene, it will be calculated throughout.
      There are a number of light sources, and 2d lighting components are separated
      from 3d lighting components. Shadowcasters can be attached to objects that
      should obstruct the casting of light, separately from physics colliders. Layer
      data can also be used, so you can have invisible objects cast shadows or have
      collidable and/or visible objects that don't cast shadows.

  - heading: Connecting Scenes
    text: We have connected all scenes up through lesson 05. Can you add in a way
      to select scenes 06 and 07? They have already been added to the build order
      Scene List.
