    text: If you choose to follow any of these tutorials, I encourage you to:<br>1.
      Think about what is being done and why, potentially choosing to use a different
      approach (i.e. using the new Input System) - Especially when the Tutorial might
      be a little dated, using older approaches<br>2. Reading comments to find common
      issues and solutions. Any one of these topics can be explored in far greater
      detail, the goal here is to give you a decent starting point that both allows
      you to start working without a massive time investment, and equip you to consider
      what you may be looking for within a more involved or complicated approach
      and/or tutorial.
