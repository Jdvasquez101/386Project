    text: 'The hierarchy tree shows objects. If an object is selected either in the
      scene or in the hierarchy tree, the inspector will show their components. Objects
      can hold multiple components, which each define an element of their behavior.
      Examine the objects and their components. '

  - heading: Inspector
    text: Components have values exposed in the Inspector. These values can be changed
      and saved, creating the initial state for the scene which can be saved.<br>Some
      helpful shortcuts:<br>Q - Pan<br>W - Translate (move)<br>E - Rotate<br>R -
      Scale<br>T - Box Transform (move + change size via corners/edges)<br>Y - Universal
      Transform<br><br>You can alternate between transforming an object via their
      local scale and their global scale (most visible if you toggle it on the slanted
      piece of ground).<br><br> A slightly more advanced topic is the concept of
      creating a custom inspector interface for objects, with the Readme object (defined
      in the TutorialInfo folder) being a good example of this.

    text: This overview is for a previous version of Unity, but is more helpful from
      a beginner's perspective.

  - heading: Render Order
    text: Sorting Layer and Order in Layer can be used to ensure the desired drawing
      order, so that background objects are drawn first, appearing "behind" objects
      in the foreground which are drawn later. Try modifying the rendering settings
      so that the hexagon appears in front of the static ground objects.<br><br>Please
      note that Cameras come with near and far culling distances, so if a camera
      occupies the same z position as an object, it likely won't render.

  - heading: Play Mode
    text: By hitting the play arrow at the top, you will begin simulating your game.
      Changes made while play mode is active will not be changed - Whether they change
      as a result of gameplay or inspector editing. This can be a frustrating cause
      of confusion! Set a value in Preferences > Colors > Play Mode Tint to gently
      remind yourself if play mode is active. The only exception for this behavior
      is scriptableobjects, which will be examined in more detail in a later example.

  - heading: Layers
    text: Objects can be assigned layers in the inspector, which can be used to define
      their interactions with each other. In Project Settings > Physics 2d, you can
      see and modify the layer collision matrix. Objects can individually include
      or exclude layers for collisions. Layers have names, but are internally evaluated
      via their layer index. The dynamic objects are given the Units layer, and the
      red hexagon is given the Background layer, observe what happens if these layers
      are changed.

  - heading: Physics Interactions
    text: 'Physics interactions require two components on relevant objects: A collider,
      and a rigidbody.<br>Dynamic rigidbodies are subject to force from collisions
      and gravity.<br>Static rigidbodies are intended to remain motionless, and are
      unaffected by forces or collisions.<br>Kinematic rigidbodies are intended to
      be moved only by scripting, and not physics forces.<br><br>Colliders can also
      be used without a rigidbody via the "Is Trigger" boolean. While collisions
      with physics objects will trigger the OnCollisionEnter2D method, a physics
      object entering a trigger collider will initiate the OnTriggerEnter2D method'

  - heading: Physics Details
    text: Physics Objects can have materials applied that determine how much friction
      and bounciness is applied upon collisions. Friction will not be applied to
      circle colliders (idealized rolling does not incur friction), but the linear
      damping value on the rigidbody will have an impact. Tweak values and experiment
      with lightweight scenes to get an idea of what works and what feels good or
      "right".<br><br>Rigidbodies will make use of colliders in their children, unless
      their children have rigidbodies of their own.
