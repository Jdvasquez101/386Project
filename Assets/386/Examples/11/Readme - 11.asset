  - heading: Coding Shaders
    text: 'Unity allows developers to write custom shaders using a combination of
      ShaderLab and HLSL. HLSL is more generally used within DirectX applications,
      and ShaderLab is a markdown-like language that organizes and coordinates HLSL
      shaders. HLSL is a standardized format, is well suited to version control and '

  - heading: Shader Graph
    text: Unity has created a node-based graph system to simplify the process of
      creating shaders. It is also possible to create custom nodes using your own
      HLSL code, though a substantial amount of common functionality is provided
      by default. It is great for prototyping, but may have issues with certain functionality,
      as it gets more complex, and being maintained. It is also not provided in a
      universal format, meaning any code created will not be transferrable to projects
      in other platforms.

  - heading: VFX Graph
    text: '"The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to create large-scale
      visual effects for your Unity Project. The Visual Effect Graph simulates particle
      behavior on the GPU, which allows it to simulate many more particles than the
      Built-in Particle System . If you want to create visual effects that include
      a large number of particles and need highly customisable behavior, use the
      Visual Effect Graph instead of the Built-in Particle System."'
