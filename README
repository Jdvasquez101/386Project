This repository is a project for Unity 6 LTS (6000.0 56f1) that contains class material and examples for CPSC 386.
You are encouraged to use the objects and code to learn from, and expand upon.

In order to open this within unity, please:
1. Clone this repository using git
   a. While you may find downloading a zip more convenient, using git clone will enable you to pull any future updates, and will be necessary for
a suitable workflow within your Unity projects where you are required to use git. It is very easy to make unintended changes in Unity, and it is
helpful to be able to detect and revert changes.

2. In Unity Hub, select "Add" -> "Add Project From Disk" and navigate to the location of this directory, select OK

3. Download or select the correct version of Unity when prompted (a Long Term Support version, 56f1).
   a. You may use a newer version if you wish, but you will be responsible for any bugs, errors, or future version changes if you go that route.

4. You should nearly always be working from the Assets directory within Unity, which is where you will find all relevant class content.
